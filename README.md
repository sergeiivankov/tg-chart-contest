# tg-chart-contest

Repository contains result of my work to Telegram contest for JS developers. Task of contest was writing chart library in pure JS without outer dependencies.

My solution took 3rd place in first and secons stages of contest. Link to contest result page https://contest.com/chart-js (my username in contest platform is Dark Unicorn), link to my solution https://contest.com/chart-js/entry210.

Unfortunately, source code of my solution was lost and in this repository I publish bundled (but not minified) version.
